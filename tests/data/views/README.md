This file is intended for use in tests.  It is generated by deploying the couchapp found in each directory in
`src/couchapp` and:

1. Copying the resulting source from CouchDB (or PouchDB).
2. Removing extraneous metadata.
3. Wrapping the output in the standard boilerplate used with the CouchDB/PouchDB bulk documents API

That boilerplate looks like:

    ```
    {
        "docs": [
        ]
    }
    ```

The result is a single file that can be used with the `data` option in a `gpii.pouch` database definition.
